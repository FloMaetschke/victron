# timer (in seconds) IN DEVELOPMENT!
#
#
# repeat: 60
#   - Will be used only if run programm in default time mode (Disconnection from device after collection is finished)
#   - It repeats connecting after given time, regardless at which time it was disconnected
#
#timer:
#    connected: 30  # timer how long the device is connected
#    disconnected: 120 # timer at which time the device is connected again after disconnect # during dev. for prod: 2 * 60
#    repeat: 180
#    retry: 60
#    serial: 30  # timer how long serial data mining will sleep (data can be gathered every second)


## Logging:
## possible values:
##    - syslog
##    - mqtt
logger: mqtt

## If logging is set to mqtt, these values must be filled
mqtt:
    host: 192.168.3.2
    port: 1883
    base_topic: victron
    hass: True

# Collected enitites by device type:
# If you change this, the names must be the same like in the value tables from victron.py
# These are the needed values to send a collection to logger, if other values are gathered (Usually they are from time to time), they are added to the collection too
